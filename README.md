# Statistical Modeling & Machine Learning Project  
## Overview  

This project applies statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to analyze data, extract insights, and build predictive models.  
It was developed as part of Assignment 4, with a strong emphasis on combining theoretical understanding with practical implementation.  

The workflow follows a complete data analysis pipeline, from exploratory analysis to model interpretation, focusing on clarity, rigor, and reproducibility.  

## Objectives  

The main objectives of this project are to:  

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data structure and distributions  
- Use data visualization to identify patterns, trends, and relationships  
- Apply probability theory and resampling methods to quantify uncertainty  
- Conduct statistical hypothesis testing to validate assumptions  
- Build and interpret classification and regression models  
- Emphasize model interpretability, not only predictive performance  

## Methods & Techniques  

The project covers a wide range of statistical and machine learning methods, including:  

- Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Data Visualization  
- Bootstrapping and Resampling Methods  
- Statistical Hypothesis Testing  
- ANOVA Models  
- Linear Regression and Model Selection  
- Logistic Regression  
- Classification and Regression Trees (CART)  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- Cluster Analysis  

Each technique is applied with attention to underlying assumptions, mathematical formulation, and result interpretation.  

## Key Features  

- Step-by-step model development, from simple baselines to more advanced methods  
- Interpretation of model coefficients, decision boundaries, and feature importance  
- Use of visual diagnostics to assess model behavior and fit  
- Comparison of multiple modeling approaches when relevant  

## Repository Structure  

The repository is organized to ensure clarity and reproducibility:  

- Data preprocessing and exploration  
- Modeling and evaluation  
- Visualization and interpretation  
- Well-documented and commented code  

## Purpose  

This project demonstrates:  

- A solid understanding of statistical modeling concepts  
- The ability to translate theory into practical analysis  
- Clear and structured analytical reasoning  
- Good practices in data analysis, modeling, and reporting
